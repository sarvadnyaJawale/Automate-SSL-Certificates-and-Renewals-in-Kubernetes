## About the Project
Managing SSL/TLS certificates manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, leading to potential downtime and security vulnerabilities. This project automates certificate lifecycle management in Kubernetes clusters, ensuring secure communication without manual intervention.
---

### Key Features
- Automated Certificate Issuance and Renewal: Leveraging cert-manager and Let‚Äôs Encrypt.
- Ingress Controller Integration: Secure traffic routing with TLS termination.
- Scalability: Manage certificates for dynamic and growing infrastructure.
- Cost-Effective: Use free certificates provided by Let‚Äôs Encrypt.
---

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and deploy automated SSL management in your Kubernetes cluster.

### 1. Prerequisites
Before setting up, ensure the following:
- A Kubernetes cluster (tested with EKS, GKE, or AKS).
- A domain name managed by a DNS provider (e.g., Route 53 or Cloudflare).
- kubectl installed and configured.
- An Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX or Traefik).

### Installation
**1. Install cert-manager:**
Apply the cert-manager manifests:
'''bash kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.2/cert-manager.yaml

**2. Configure a ClusterIssuer:**
Create a ClusterIssuer to use Let‚Äôs Encrypt for certificate issuance:
'''yaml apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-production
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your-email@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-production
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx

**3. Create an Ingress Resource:**
Annotate your Ingress to request a certificate automatically:apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
'''yaml
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - example.com
    secretName: example-com-tls

**4. Verify Certificate Status:**
Use kubectl to describe the certificate resource:
'''bash
kubectl describe certificate example-com-tls
---

## Usage
This project automates SSL management, helping you:
- Secure web applications hosted in Kubernetes.
- Prevent downtime caused by expired certificates.
- Focus on strategic tasks by reducing manual overhead.
- Simply deploy cert-manager, configure ClusterIssuers, and annotate your Ingress resources to enjoy seamless SSL/TLS management.
---

## Roadmap
- Support wildcard certificates using DNS01 challenges.
- Add monitoring and alerting integration for cert-manager using Prometheus and Grafana.
- Extend compatibility with custom Ingress controllers.
- Provide Terraform modules for easier deployment.
